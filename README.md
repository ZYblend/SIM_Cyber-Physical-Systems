# Simulation of Cyber-Physical-Systems
In this repo, we share simulation testbeds of four particular cyber-physical control systems:
- IEEE 14 bus system
- Wheeled Mobile Robot
- Networked Pipeline System
- Water Distribution System

In each simulation, physical system simulation, nominal control design, and state estimator design are listed.


## Wheeled Mobile Robot
- Both vehicle kinematic model and dynamical model 
- A nonlinear path-tracking controller
- An Unscented Kalman Filter

## IEEE 14 bus System
- A small signal model
- A Luenberger observer
- A PI controller

## Networked Pipeline System
- A nonlinear networked pipeline's pressure model
- A Model Predictive Controller
- An Unscented Kalman Filter


## Water Distribution System
- A linear 11-tanks system
- A least-square observer

## Acknowledgment
We developed these simulation systems during my five-year PhD Journey. Instead of using a simple differential equation, we use the real systems as the testbeds.
If you find these simulations useful for your research or projects, please credit me by starring the repo and citing my [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dn6dKBUAAAAJ&hl=en)!
