# Simulation of Cyber-Physical-Systems
In this repo, we share simulation testbeds of four particular cyber-physical control systems:
- IEEE 14 bus system
- Wheeled Mobile Robot
- Networked Pipeline System
- Water Distribution System

In each simulation, physical system simulation, nominal control design, and state estimator design are listed.

## IEEE 14 bus System
- A small signal model
- A Luenberger observer
- A PI controller


## Wheeled Mobile Robot
- Both vehicle kinematic model and dynamical model 
- A nonlinear path-tracking controller
- An Unscented Kalman Filter 


## Networked Pipeline System
- A nonlinear networked pipeline's pressure model
- A Model Predictive Controller
- An Unscented Kalman Filter


## Water Distribution System
- A linear 11-tanks system
- A least-square observer
-
